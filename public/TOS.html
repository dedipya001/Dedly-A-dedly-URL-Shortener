    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>By using our Dedly URL Shortener service, you agree to these fun-filled terms:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Short Links, Big Smiles:</strong> Our goal is to make your life easier with shorter links. Prepare to grin from ear to ear! We can't guarantee a perfect smile, but we promise to bring a little sparkle to your day with every link you shorten.</li>
      <li><strong>Link Responsibly:</strong> You're free to shorten URLs, but please don't use our service for anything illegal, malicious, or just plain mean. Keep it cool, folks! Using our shortener for sneaky, mischievous purposes might make us shed a tiny tear, and we don't like sad faces.</li>
      <li><strong>Tick-Tock, Link Expires:</strong> All good things must come to an end, including short links. Be prepared for links to expire after a reasonable amount of time. Just like Cinderella's pumpkin carriage, our links will eventually turn back into a long URL. But don't worry, you can always create more magic links!</li>
      <li><strong>Short ≠ Secure:</strong> Remember, while short links are handy, they can't guarantee safety. Be cautious while clicking on links from unknown sources. Our shortening elves do their best to keep things secure, but they're not invincible superheroes. Safety first, heroes!</li>
      <li><strong>No Selling, No Yelling:</strong> Don't try to sell our shortening service or yell at our support team. We promise we'll do our best to help you out! Selling our service might result in bad karma, and we prefer good karma—luck and happiness all around!</li>

      <li><strong>Have Fun, It's Shortening Time:</strong> Above all, have a blast shortening those long links. We're here to make it easy and entertaining. Get ready to embark on a fantastic URL shortening adventure! Embrace the joy of trimming, and let your URLs shine like stars in the night sky.</li>
    </ol>
