      <h2>Your Privacy is Our Top Secret!</h2>
      <p>
        At Dedly, we take your privacy as seriously as a spy on a top-secret mission. We are committed to protecting your personal data like it's the key to unlock a hidden treasure.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Collection and Usage</h3>
      <p>
        We may collect some of your non-classified information, such as your name, email address, and favorite spy movie. Rest assured, we won't sell, trade, or give away your data to supervillains. We only use it to improve our services and to make your URL shortening experience smoother than James Bond's moves.
      </p>
      <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Like a stealthy ninja, we use cookies and other tracking technologies to gather data about your visit. But don't worry, we won't follow you like a secret agent on a mission. It's all for website analytics and improving our espionage skills.
        <br>
        Remember, we're in this together. Your data's security is our mission, but we also need your help. Just as secret agents keep their eyes peeled for potential threats, we encourage you to be vigilant and practice safe internet habits. Avoid sharing your password like a secret recipe, and don't click on suspicious links, no matter how tempting they may be.
      </p>
      <h3>Third-Party Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        We won't share your top-secret information with third parties unless required by law or when our spy headquarters gets infiltrated (which is unlikely).So, keep using Dedly to shorten your URLs with confidence, and feel like a spy navigating the digital world, with your privacy shielded by our cutting-edge technology. Together, we'll keep your online adventures safe and sound, just like an action-packed blockbuster movie!
      </p>
      <h3>Security Measures</h3>
      <p>
        We've got state-of-the-art security measures in place to safeguard your data, just like a high-tech gadget from Q. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, just like escaping from a room full of lasers.
      </p>
      <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        In the ever-changing world of espionage, our Privacy Policy might be updated occasionally. We'll keep you informed, just like a secret agent briefing. So make sure to check back here from time to time.
      </p>
      <p class="top-secret">
        Remember, we're here to protect your privacy like it's a matter of national security. Trust Dedly for all your URL shortening needs and rest easy, knowing your secrets are safe with us!
